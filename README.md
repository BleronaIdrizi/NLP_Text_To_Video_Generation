# Text-to-Video Generation

This project was developed as part of the academic program at the University of Prishtina “Hasan Prishtina,” within the Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering for the course Natural Language Processing, under the guidance of Mërgim Hoti.

The objective of this project is to develop a model that can interpret natural language descriptions and generate corresponding short video clips. The project aims to bridge the gap between text-based generation and multimedia generation by advancing beyond static content creation. To achieve this goal, a dataset showcasing the wonders of food composition was utilized. This dataset includes a wide variety of dishes, ranging from simple bread recipes to elaborate Swedish midsummer smorgasbords. It is available on the **[Recipe Dataset (over 2M) Food](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wilmerarltstrmberg/recipe-dataset-over-2m)** through the Kaggle platform.
